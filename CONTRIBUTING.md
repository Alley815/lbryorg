You can use emojis which must be in `:emojiname:`format

- <u>**bg-image:**</u> You can add Customized background images for each pages . To do that upload your image in `/img` then copy the relative path and paste it here.
- <u>**layout:**</u> Layout refers to the page layouts included in `_layout` Folder. `Default` is the common layout for most pages.
- <u>**permalink:**</u> Permalink is a relative path to pages. Usually pages exist in root directory. The format is `/Pagename/` For example in Swarm page It's `/swarm/`

----------
### Libs AKA Assets
----------
All assets [Except images] are loaded from `/lib`Folder

- **_includes:** Contains header , head , nav and footer of `default.html`

- **/img** folder contains all the images used in the site

- **/lib/** :

  - <u>**bootstrap:**</u>  Contains all bootstrap ingredients 

  - <u>**css:**</u> Contains all the css used in both homepage and and article pages

  - <u>**fontawesome:**</u> Contains awesome fonts

  - <u>**fonts/oxygen:**</u> Contains "oxygenfonts" from google

  - <u>**jquery:**</u> Of course jquery script :slightly_smiling_face:

  - <u>**JS:**</u> contains all the JS scripts used in the site 

----------
### Editing an existing page
-----
Editing an existing page is as easy as breaking a wall with a Pin [Just a Joke ðŸ˜‰]
- <u>**Markdowns:**</u> <br>
  Most Text rich pages pull their Text contents from Markdown files located in `root directory`. To edit simply Locate the related markdown / .md file and Edit it using a text editor with [Proper Syntaxes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) 

- <u>**HTML:**</u> <br> Homepage and layout > Default.html [*in ./_layouts*] can be easily edited using a Code Editor . For more    references  those codes are Well-commented.

---

###  Adding New pages

--------

Adding new pages are easy as breathing [Well in most cases :stuck_out_tongue:] . <br>

- <u>**Step 1:**</u> Create

  Create and upload a markdown file using this layout

  ```markdown
  ---
  title : Pagetitle
  subhead : Some funky and simple subheading :emoji:
  bg-image : "../img/pathtoBackGround-Image.png"
  layout : layoutname [default]
  permalink : /filename/
  ---
  Markdown based content and stylings
  blah blah blah
  blah blah blah
  The End
  ```
  
  
  


  
- <u>**Step 2:**</u> Add in `./_includes/navlinks.html`

  Scroll down to `NavLinksPart for HOMEPAGE` section which starts and ends with `<!-- NavLinksPart for HOMEPAGE -->` comment <br>
  
  add a line `<a class="nav-item nav-link" href="./asinpermalink/">PageName</a> ` <br>
  

- <u>**Step 3:**</u> Add in `./_includes/navlinks.html` 

  Scroll down to `NavLinksPart for DefaultLayoutsPages` section which starts and ends with `<!-- NavLinksPart for DefaultLayoutsPages -->` comment <br>
  
  add a line `<a class="nav-item nav-link" href="../asinpermalink/">PageName</a> ` <br>
  
  Save :beer:
  
  ![NavLinks](https://i.imgur.com/fcqeZVy.png)
  
  
  
## Remember : In `NavLinksPart for HOMEPAGE` there is one dot[./] in `<a>---href=""<a>` But in `NavLinksPart for DefaultLayoutsPages` there's TWO DOTS [../] 

So don't  copy paste same thing in two places :wink: .

### Adding a new layout

----

All new layouts goes into `_layouts` folder . Try to keep it's name case insensitive and easily readable.

Head to jekyll docs for more detailed explaination about  [creating layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/) .

Which ever layout you create make sure **NOT TO CREATE NEW CODES THAT ARE ALREADY MADE ** in `_includes` Most importantly the **Nav bar**
